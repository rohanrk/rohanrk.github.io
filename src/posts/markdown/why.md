# Why...?

## did you start this blog?

I honestly have no clue. 

Writing has always been a challenge and the idea of putting words on a page for the world to read is an intimidating prospect. 

But lately I've been inspired by various blogs, creators, and conference speakers on the interwebs. So I figured that I too would embark on the challenge of expressing myself through words on a screen! 

Right now I'm using this as an opportunity to write about technical concepts that I'm not familiar with in the hopes that maybe it will give me an opportunity to dive into them and possibly help someone else in the future.

But I love thinking and sharing my thoughts about a lot of subjects, most of which I'm not qualified to have an opinion on! 

So expect any amount of tech rants, book reviews, and thoughts on the current fate of my career choice! I hope you either find my words useful or entertaining (in that order).

## are you in tech?

Originally, I wanted to be a game designer. Though my interests evolved, my desire to whisper to computers never changed, so here I am!

## not use Medium?

Because this site was a great excuse to learn React and it keeps my Github history green. Obligatory [Javascript talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat).
