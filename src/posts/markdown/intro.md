## What is SRE?

Site Reliability Engineering is a form of software and systems' engineering with a focus ensuring a specific service remains up and running.

Often, that means building automation and tooling surrounding the system to monitor, alert, and automate various processes within a system.

While there's an operational component to SRE, the end goal is to use software engineering principles to detect, observe, and improve the resilience of a service.
